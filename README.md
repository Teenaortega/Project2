Problem Statement: 
I am a Magic: The Gathering player and need a place search for cards and to store my deck list online.
M:TG has thousands of cards and it is overwhelming for new players. Having an easy to use application that can help filter through cards and save them to a deck list will be helpful to make deck building less complex.
